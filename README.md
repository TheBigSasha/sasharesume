# Sasha's Resume
A website to host my resume.

## My Vision - Skimmable, Eye Catching
From sending out 3 different resumes to different companies, of varying levels of complexity and detail, and gathering data as to which style of resume got the most callbacks, I was able to determine that one design concept rules over all _less is more_. A resume needs to be two things: eye catching and skimmable. This idea, however, was contradictory with the need to convey the detail and complexity of one's experience.
**To this paradox, there could only be one solution: an interactive resume.**

## Interactive System
This site lets a viewer explore one's experience and qualifcations at a glance. They are presented with an elegant cascade of cards which show only a short headline of each entry in the resume. Upon a hover or a tap, the card grows with additonal details and information, and each card hosts a link to an even deeper level of exploration.

## Fully Responsive Design
Designed from the ground up for both mobile and desktop users, this website works beautifully no matter what screen its viewed on. It elegantly cascades its cards to a single column for a phone, and then grows to fill a desktop browser efficiently. It also automatically rearranges seamlessly into a beautifully formatted paper resume upon printing. Safari's reader view is fully supported.
